        "Welcome to the feature selection evaluation task! Below are the instructions you need to follow to complete this exercise.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **1. Objective**\n",
        "The goal is to select the optimal set of features that maximizes the AUC score while using the **minimum number of features**. You will:\n",
        "- Propose a feature list (e.g., 8, 10, 20 features).\n",
        "- Train and test a model using these features.\n",
        "- Measure AUC and verify which features are truly contributing to model performance.\n",

        "### **Load the Dataset**\n",
        "- The dataset is provided in the notebook or as a file.\n",
        "- Load the dataset into your environment using `pandas`.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **3. Steps to Complete the Task**\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Step 1: Split the Data**\n",
        "1. Split the dataset into **training** and **testing** sets.\n",
        "   - Suggested ratio: 80% training, 20% testing.\n",
        "   - Use `train_test_split` from `sklearn` to ensure a random but reproducible split.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Step 2: Select Features**\n",
        "2. Decide on a list of features you think are important:\n",
        "   - **Example**: Start with 8, 10, or 20 features.\n",
        "   - Select features based on any method you prefer (e.g., domain knowledge, correlation, feature importance from models like Random Forest, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Step 3: Train a Model**\n",
        "3. Train a model using your chosen features:\n",
        "   - Use any binary classification model you prefer (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.).\n",
        "   - Ensure the model is trained only on the **training set**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Step 4: Evaluate**\n",
        "4. Evaluate the model on the **test set**:\n",
        "   - Measure the **AUC score**.\n",
        "   - Identify which features significantly impact the AUC score.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **4. Criteria for Evaluation**\n",
        "- You must aim to **minimize the number of features** while maintaining a high AUC score.\n",
        "- **Do not select features arbitrarily**:\n",
        "  - If your initial feature list includes features that have no significant impact, you are expected to refine the selection.\n",
        "  - Keep features only if they improve or maintain the AUC score.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **5. Recommendations**\n",
        "- Use any method to calculate feature importance (e.g., Random Forest feature importance, SHAP values, etc.).\n",
        "- Document your process clearly:\n",
        "  - List the selected features.\n",
        "  - Show the AUC scores before and after feature refinement.\n",
        "  - Explain why specific features were kept or removed.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **6. Deliverables**\n",
        "By the end of the task, you should submit:\n",
        "1. A final AUC score on the **test set**.\n",
        "2. A list of selected features.\n",
        "3. A brief explanation of your process and decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Notes**\n",
        "- The dataset contains **X features** and **Y target**.\n",
        "- Aim for an initial selection of **8-10 features**, but you can experiment with more or fewer as you refine the list."
