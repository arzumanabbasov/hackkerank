  # To enable scoring, add the scoring command below. You can upload files required
  # for scoring under the "Evaluation files" section below. These files will not be
  # available to the candidates. At the time of evaluation, we will download these
  # files under the "evaluation_files" folder. Assuming you uploaded "score.py" and
  # "expected_output.csv", the sample scoring command configuration is given below:

  scoring:
    command: python evaluation_files/score.py evaluation_files/expected_output.csv submission.csv

  # Ensure that the evaluation script can handle edge cases and return a score in
  # all possible scenarios. An erroneous response will result in a no score, and
  # you will be required to review the submission manually.
